# Ways to list disks, partitions and filesystems in Linux
----------------------------------------------------------
There are several ways to list all the hard drives present in a system through Linux command lines.
Keep in mind a hard drive could be physically connected, virtually connected or even emulated.
There are other commands but these are probably the most commonly used and easy to get the job done.
Also note that some of these commands are actually disk partitioning tools and listing disk partition is one of their features.

Let’s see what commands you can use to show disk info in Linux.
```1.df ``` 
df lists the actual “disk space usage” and it can give you information about what hard disks (or current disk space) is being used in the entire system.
The most common way to use it is with the -h argument which means “human readable”
